            <p>I am an undergrad student pursuing B. Tech in Electrical engineering at <a href="http://dtu.ac.in/">Delhi Technological University</a>.</p>
            <p>
                I from a very young age was very curious child. In my early days when I used to go to my village during summer holidays, I was very curious about equipments and techniques used in farming. As I grew up I was always attracted by different types of machines
                and used to observe thier mechanisms. This way I slowly developed an interest in engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also found that engineering was one of the most common career choices and so I had to face tough competition to get into the premium emgineering institutions. I therefore cracked <strong>JEE MAINS</strong> and <strong>JEE Advanced</strong>.
                During that phase I got deeply interested in Physics.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I got into Delhi Technological University, it felt like an achievement and I was excited to explore as much as I could. Being in electrical major I studied core electrical and electronics subjects and also tried to explore other domains of engineering.
                Apart from academics, in the first year of my engineering I joined The Indian Game Theory Society and learned various ways of strategic thinking. In the second year of engineering I tried to explore electrical engineering and started a
                project on developing a MATLAB program to develop graphical representation of PMU data. In third year I tried to explore electronics and started an IoT based "Wrong Side Vehicle Detection" project. In this project I learned about AI and
                Machine Learning and after completion of this project I started "Neural Machine Translation" as a project and also took few online courses to gain extensive knolwdge of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. During the development of these
                projects I felt the requirement of programming skills. Therefore, in fourth year of engineering I am exploring programming skills, I enjoy giving contests on Codechef and Codeforces and I surely can explore the never ending universe of
                programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                From an early age I have been inspired by the questions of life like who we are? How this universe began to operate? What should I do so that when I get old I could look back and have good memories and not a regret? What governs the love and hatred that
                can be seen in society? So far I have just got that the best we can do is play our part to the best we can. I love reading books to get better idea on life and to get answers to my questions. I like to spend time with my family and friends.
